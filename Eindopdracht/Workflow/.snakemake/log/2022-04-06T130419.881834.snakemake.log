Job 6: executing bwa mem on the following ../Resources/Glycine_max_soybean.faa ../Resources/SRR2073062.fastq to generate the following ../Results/mapped_reads/SRR2073062.bam

[Wed Apr  6 13:04:20 2022]
Error in rule bwa_map:
    jobid: 6
    output: ../Results/mapped_reads/SRR2073062.bam
    shell:
        bwa mem ../Resources/Glycine_max_soybean.faa ../Resources/SRR2073062.fastq | samtools view -Sb - > ../Results/mapped_reads/SRR2073062.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bwa_map since they might be corrupted:
../Results/mapped_reads/SRR2073062.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
