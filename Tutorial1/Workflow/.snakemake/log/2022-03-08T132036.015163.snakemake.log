MissingOutputException in line 7 of /homes/ijapool/PycharmProjects/Dataprocessing2/Tutorial1/Workflow/Snakefile.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
Results/Sample1.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 2 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
